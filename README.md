# ML PROJECT -  TO GRANT OR NOT TO GRANT: DECIDING ON COMPENSATION BENEFITS


## Project Overview  
The New York Workersâ€™ Compensation Board (WCB) plays a crucial role in regulating and adjudicating claims related to workplace injuries, volunteer workers, and other compensation cases. Since 2000, the WCB has handled over 5 million claims, making manual claim reviews an increasingly time-consuming and complex process.  

To address this challenge, Nova IMS partnered with the WCB to develop a machine learning solution aimed at automating decision-making for new claims. This project focuses on building, evaluating, and optimizing classification models to predict the type of injury (Claim Injury Type) associated with a claim, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the WCB's operations.
